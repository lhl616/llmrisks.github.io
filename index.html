<p>Since one of the groups made the analogy to tobacco products, I also will take the liberty of pointing to a talk I gave at Google making a similar analogy: <a href="https://uvasrg.github.io/google-federated-privacy-2019-the-dragon-in-the-room/"><em>The Dragon in the Room</em></a>.</p>
<p>Stephanie made the point after class about how important individuals
making brave decisions is to things working out, in particular with
humanity (so far!) avoiding annihilating ourselves with nuclear
weapons. Stanislav Petrov may well have been the single person between
us and nuclear destruction in 1983, when he prevented an alert (which
he correctly determined was a false alarm) produced by the Soviet
detection system from going up the chain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one (of many)
articles on this: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm"><em>&lsquo;I Had A Funny Feeling in My
Gut&rsquo;</em></a>,
Washington Post, 10 Feb 1999. There is still a lot of uncertainty and
skepticism if we should be fearing any kind of out-of-control AI risk,
but it is not so hard to imagine scenarios where our fate will
similarly come down to an individual&rsquo;s decision at a critical
juncture. (On the other hand, this article argues that we shouldn&rsquo;t
oversensationalize Petrov&rsquo;s actions and there were many other
safeguards between him and nuclear war, and we really shouldn&rsquo;t design
extinction-level systems in a way that they are so fragile to depend on an individual decision: <a href="https://russianforces.org/blog/2022/10/did_stanislav_petrov_save_the_.shtml"><em>Did Stanislav Petrov save the world in 1983? It&rsquo;s complicated</em></a>, from a Russian perspective.)</p>

<p><strong>LLM agents</strong> are the &ldquo;next big thing&rdquo;, with the potential to directly impact important fields like healthcare and education. Essentially, they are LLM-based systems that have the ability to use external tools, such as Internet browsing access and calculators, to augment their abilities.</p>

<p>LLMs have limitations that can potentially be addressed with these &ldquo;tools&rdquo;:</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>

<ul>
<li><strong>Outdated information</strong>: LLMs cannot access up-to-date information without access to external sources. Giving them the ability to access realtime information (via Internet queries) would lead to better responses, such as &ldquo;who is the President of USA today?&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Hallucination</strong>: External knowledge sources can help ground generation in facts and work to supplement the model&rsquo;s knowledge, reducing the possibility of hallucinating.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of mathematical skills</strong>: Access to a calculator can help model generate correct responses and computations involving math. Using zero-shot learning can help reduce hallucination, but providing access to a calculator (assuming it is used correctly) can guarantee correct responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other limitations include limited multi-language usability, having no concept of ‚Äútime‚Äù, etc.</p>

<p>The main idea is to develop a system that has the ability to use external tools (translation, calendar, search engine, etc.).
The key lies in knowing <em>when</em> to use a tool, <em>which</em> tool to use, and <em>how</em> to use it. Training is self-supervised, unlike other capability-enhancing techniques like RLHF.</p>

<p>Key step: generating candidate API calls via in-context learning. The method starts with examples generated by humans, e.g. in-context examples for ‚ÄúCoca-Cola‚Äù, etc.</p>

<p>Tokens up to the position with an ‚Äú<API>‚Äù tag are provided to get $m$ candidate API calls.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>
</table>
<p>An additional weighted loss term is introduced, corresponding to the utility of information added after using candidate API calls. This loss term is meant to provide feedback for which API calls were useful for some given context.</p>
<table><tr>
  <td><img src="../images/week12/day1/LLM_Agents_MondayPres_Page_16.jpg" width="95%"></td>
</tr>
  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>
</table>
<p>Given the loss term and general strategy for inserting <code>&lt;API&gt;</code> tokens, the model is fine-tuned with the augmented dataset. At prediction time, the model uses a variant of greedy decoding, making API calls if the <code>&lt;API&gt;</code> tag is in the top-k predictions at any token position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Evans talked about how the method could benefit from having some ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù from the API‚Äôs quality of response, and not having an implicit bias in the design that considers API calls as ‚Äúcostly‚Äù.</p>

<p>Interestingly, performance for some cases (ASDiv, Table 4) is better for the version with disabled API calls (so no agent-like behavior) than the variant equipped with API-returned information.</p>

<ul>
<li>For small model sizes, performance does not change much with the inclusion of external knowledge.</li>
<li>The utility of API calls is clearer for larger models, where performance drops significantly when API calls are disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of limitations, these tools cannot be used ‚Äúin chain‚Äù (an in iterative-refinement approach, where multiple API calls are made) and require sampling a lot of data.</p>

<li><strong>Using LLMs</strong>: starts with profile generation rules (can specify via few-shot examples), controllable seeding for profiles.</li>
<li><strong>Dataset Alignment Method</strong>: foundation of agent design, and has significant influence on the following 3 modules.</li>

<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>

<p><strong>Structures:</strong> Unified memory is short-term and simulates our &ldquo;working memory&rdquo; (added via context), while hybrid combined short-term and long-term memory tries to model human recollection better.</p>

<p><strong>Formats:</strong> natural language is interpretable and flexible. Embeddings compromise on this flexibility, with the added benefit of being very efficient. Databases allow efficient manipulation of &ldquo;memories&rdquo;, and structured lists can also be used.</p>

<p><strong>Operations:</strong> Memory reading allows for weighted retrieval of information, with operations for reading (memory reflection) and updating (memory writing) information.</p>

<p>Without feedback, planning may proceed via single reasoning (dependent, connected steps), multi-path reasoning (tree-like structure, kind-of approximates human thinking?), or using external planners (using domain-specific planners).</p>
<p>Similarly, planning with feedback may rely on information from humans (e.g. RLHF), environmental feedback (e.g. RL for game simulation), or model feedback (using other pre-trained models).</p>

<li>Agents can have different targets: task completion, communication (communicate with other agents/humans), or exploration (explore vs. exploit tradeoff).</li>

<li>Their exploration space may include API calls, or internal knowledge.</li>

<p>Performance seems pretty good with GPT-4 (Left, ~35%) but when names are obfuscated (Right), plan generation results drop to 0-2%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Evans talked about how the benchmarks are not a comparison with human performance, which would also understandably go down when names are obfuscated. It is thus unclear whether these drops in performance are expected (given that humans are bad at the modified task as well), or a result of the model not really &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; how to solve the given task. An alternate explanation for these results, would just be that the model has a hard time identifying entities that are labeled with non-sensical, multi-token strings that don&rsquo;t revaal them to be blocks. That said, there is tons of data about Blocksworld in the training data, so a difficult domain to test what the model is really learning (if anything).</p>

<li><em>What are your thoughts on LLM reasonig/planning?</em> We talked how in psychology, reasoning is divided into 3 domains (knowledge acquisition, reasoning, decision making). Even for the literature in this field, it is unclear how these three domains interact with each other, and thus even more complicated for LLMs.</li>
<li><em>How should we proceed with this line of research?</em> We acknowledged how it is difficult to define ‚Äúplanning‚Äù for both humans, and even more so for LLMs. Professor Evans mentioned that for this line of work to advance, we need to come up with a good benchmark (but this is very labor-intensive). Students recalled work on performing activities in Minecraft as a useful benchmark for planning and agents. The ‚Äúgranularity‚Äù of planning is much more nuanced - humans can infer steps in between (or use domain knowledge), but harder if talking about agents or &ldquo;just LLMs&rdquo;. At the same time, we do not have a good answer for &ldquo;should we expect our model to behave more like a hard-coded program or like a human (performance changes due to new factors, ex. Semantic changes, etc)?&rdquo;</li>

<p>The experimental setup comprises two restaurants, serving as competitive agents, and fourteen customers, acting as judge agents. To confine the action space of the Large Language Model (LLM), a management system is employed. This system functions as a question provider, formulating precise inquiries for the LLM to ensure that its output remains within the defined action space. The customers exercise their judgment when evaluating offers from both restaurants, ultimately selecting based on their individual constraints and requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>LLM scores can act as a baseline, but there is always a possibility of bias. For instance, changing the order of options presented to the model may sometimes result in a different score being outputted.</li>
<li>Designing a model based solely off of customer/restaurant data fails to capture other experiences of dining (i.e. customer service, environment/ambience, etc.) and thus indicates the simulation‚Äôs low fidelity. Capturing decision-making factors in customers is especially difficult, as they are difficult to define and quantify. The current simulation does not account for customers‚Äô risk-aversion for trying new dishes, and it also does not consider the influence of star ratings or reviews on customers‚Äô decisions to choose between the two restaurants. There may also be issues with prompt-based tasks, such as over-generalization.</li>
<li>Utilizing simulations has the potential for real-world social trends and phenomena to be reproduced without requiring a large number of real people or complex variables; it is not necessary to recreate an entire town in order to gain insights into real-world trends.</li>

<p>Agents are able to learn from each other while maintaining differentiation. This is visible in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agents <strong>imitate</strong> observed strategies that provide a high reward. For example, a restaurant may copy the popular dishes of another restaurant to compete for their clinetele.</li>
<li>Conversely, <strong>differentiation</strong> is used to attract patrons that the competing agents don&rsquo;t specifically cater to; one restaurant may provide inexpensive food for customers on a budget while another provides fine-dining options.</li>

<li>Is competition among agents the best mechanism to take advantage of their capabilities? What are the limitations of this approach?</li>
<li>What other interactions are feasible?</li>
<li>What are the benefits and risks and/or pros and cons of these interactions as compared to competition among agents?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Collaborative Approach Limitations:</strong> One potential drawback of adopting a collaborative approach is the propensity for bias in a single agent to propagate through multiple agents, thus amplifying its impact.</p>
<p><strong>Employing Negotiation-Based Tasks and Games:</strong> In the context of collaborative endeavors, employing negotiation-based tasks and games is a valuable strategy. These involve the participation of diverse agents, such as a managerial figure, a chef, and a waiter, each representing distinct stakeholders. The amalgamation of their inputs contributes to a holistic decision-making process.</p>
<p><strong>The Feasibility of Restaurant Collaboration:</strong> We explored the possibility of restaurants engaging in collaborative efforts, including the exchange of information regarding signature dishes, the potential collusion to elevate pricing structures collectively, and the coordination of operational hours. However, it is essential to consider potential drawbacks, particularly the willingness of competitors to engage in such cooperative ventures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Limitations of having collaborative approach: bias in one agent might cascade into bias in multiple agents.</li>
<li>Discussed negotiation-based tasks and negotiation games to collaborate with each other. For instance, one could have an ensemble of different agents (i.e. manager agent makes final decision, chef has a say, waiter has a say, etc.)
Each agent represents different stakeholder</li>
<li>Discussed how restaurants could collaborate together, e.g. communicate signature dishes, collude to raise prices of everything, coordinate times they are open. Noted potential downsides, including willingess to collaborate and power dynamics between agents.</li>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17512">CompeteAI: Understanding the Competition Behaviors in Large Language Model-based Agents</a> paper shows that LLM agents can be used for simulating the competition environment. How might the competition behaviors observed in LLM-based agents translate to other real-world applications where strategic competition is critical? Essentially, are there specific characteristics unique to the restaurant setting that might not directly apply to other sectors?</li>
<li>What are some considerations (ethical or otherwise) that may arise as a result of programming LLMs to compete with each other, especially considering the possibility of this being implemented in real world scenarios? If there are valid concerns, how could the models be calibrated to ensure that the competition remains ethical, preventing the agents from learning and adopting potentially harmful or deceptive strategies?</li>
<li>Agents can be used in various ways. One way is to make them compete (like in the CompeteAI paper). Instead of competing, how can agents be used in other ways (e.g. by collaborating/communicating with each other), and how might this impact their behavior?</li>
<li>Given the adaptive nature of LLM-based agents in a competitive environment, how can we ensure transparency and interpretability in the decision-making processes of these agents, so that stakeholders can understand and trust the outcomes of such simulations?</li>

<h1 id="monday-november-6-watermarking-llm-outputs">Monday, November 6: Watermarking LLM Outputs</h1>
<p>Recent instances of AI-generated text passing for human text and the
writing of students being misattributed to AI suggest the need for a
tool to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text. The
presenters also noted that the increase in the amount of AI-generated
text online is a risk for training future LLMs on this data.</p>
<p>A proposed solution is to embed a watermark in the output of text
generation models.</p>

<p><strong>Token-based watermarking:</strong> given a word in a sequence, token-based watermarking uses a hash function to initialize a random number generator used to create two sets of all possible next words: the &ldquo;green&rdquo; word list and the &ldquo;red&rdquo; word list.</p>

<p>The algorithm from the paper uses the language model probabilities to
separate words using a hash function-based random number generator.</p>

<li>What are your thoughts on artificial intelligence regulations? And do you believe/think we can/should tame AI&rsquo;s power through stiff regulatory control?</li>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>
</table>
<p>The main intuition is that the Sentences given to a paraphrasing tool will not be detected as AI but sentences inputted to the LLM may be detected as AI. The output source for an LLM is limited than doing paraphrasing because Paraphrased Sentences (PS) would have a larger set. Why is the paraphrased sentences set larger than the LLM sentences (LS) set? That is because LLMs try to maintain the same meaning and that limits their performance.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"><b></b></td>

<p>If LS becomes as large as the PS, this will cause Type 1 error because it becomes increasingly hard to detect PS.</p>
<p>If PS goes close to LS, this will cause Type 2 error because it would become increasingly hard to detect the LS now.</p>

<p>The class talked more about if it is misinformation, does it matter if its AI-generated or not? What is more important is that it should be marked as misinformation, not that if it is AI generated or human crafted.</p>
<p>Are there cases where we actually care about watermarks? And one case is where an AI tool writes a book and publishes it. Maybe the problem is volume of the text generated more than the content. This causes a loss to human creators and poses unbeatable competition in terms of speed. The detection is more about the volume than it is about the use of it in one instance.</p>

<p>Some points that came up during discussion:</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ GAN model is distribution to distribution vs dissusion is image to distribution</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ The size of <em>z</em> is different for each model</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Need more time to train diffusion models</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ GAN is less stable and managing gradient is not there with the other models</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Diffusion model is more robust to noise and is more controllable</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ GAN can take in some contextual input but diffusion models are more flexible because they can take in more context</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ Sometimes we can see the decrease in image quality with a watermark so there is a tradeoff between quality and watermarking.</p>
<p>‚Ä¢ There will always be an adversary to figure out how to reverse the process of watermakring (or we should at least assume so), so this field still needs growth and more proof of irreversibility.</p>

<h2 id="question-any-potential-applications-of-llms-as-a-judge">Question: Any potential applications of LLMs as a Judge?</h2>
<p>As summarized from the Week 10 discussion channels, there could be many potential applications of LLMs as a Judge, such as accessing writing quality, checking harmful content, judging if social media post is factually correct or biased, evaluating if code is optimal.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start from Paper 1:
Zheng, Lianmin, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zi Lin et al. &ldquo;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05685.pdf">Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena.</a>&rdquo; arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05685 (2023).</p>
<p>Multi-Turn questions provide a different way to query GPT. In this paper, the authors ask multi-turn dialogues to two different assistants.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide6.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>The paper provides two benchmarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The MT-bench provides a multi-turn question set, and it challenges chatbot to do difficult questions.</li>
<li>The Chatbot Arena that provides a crowdsourced battle platform that reveals two options for human to choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>The results shows that</p>
<ul>
<li>GPT-4 is the best, which matches both controlled (MT-bench) and crowdsourced (Arena) human preferences.</li>
<li>Regardless of pair or single, it exceeds over 80% of agreement with the human subjects.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide8.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>This shows that stong LLMs can be a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences. Some advantages and disadvantages were introduced for LLM-as-a-Judge.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalability: Human evaluation is time-consuming and expensive</li>
<li>Consistency: Human judgment varies by individuals</li>
<li>Explainability: LLMs can be trained to evaluate and provide reasons of their judgements</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Position Bias: Bias towards responses based on their position (preferring the first response)</li>
<li>Verbosity Bias: Favor longer, more verbose answers regardless of accuracy</li>
<li>Overfitting: LLMs might overfit the training data, don‚Äôt generalize to new, unseen responses</li>
</ul>

<p>The above potential of fine-tuning open-source model (there could be interpretability problems) leads to a question: &ldquo;the paper motivates wanting to be able to emulate the performance of stronger, closed-source models - <em>can we imitate these models?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="imitation-models">Imitation Models</h1>
<p>Paper 2: Gudibande, A., Wallace, E., Snell, C., Geng, X., Liu, H., Abbeel, P., Levine, S. and Song, D., 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15717.pdf"><em>The false promise of imitating proprietary LLMs</em></a>. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.15717.</p>
<p>To start the second paper, let&rsquo;s do a class poll about which output people would prefer.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide13.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>Most of the class chose Output A.</p>
<p>Here, let&rsquo;s look into the definition of model imitation:
&ldquo;<em>The premise of model imitation is that once a proprietary LM is made available via API, one can collect a dataset of API outputs and use it to fine-tune an open-source LM.</em>&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The goal of model imitation is to imitate the capablity of the proprietary LM.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide16.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>This shows that the Broad Imitation can be more difficult than Local Imitation as Local Imitation is only for specific tasks. However, Broad Imitation requires gathering of a diverse dataset and the imitation model needs to capture that distribution to have similar output.</p>
<p>To build imitation datasets, there are two primary approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural Examples</strong>: If you have a set of inputs in mind, (e.g. tweets about a specific topic), use them to query the target model.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Examples</strong>: Prompt the target model to iteratively generate examples from the same distribution as an initial small seed set of inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper used two curated datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Task-Specific Imitation Using Synthetic Data: <strong>NQ Synthetic</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Broad Imitation Using Natural Data: <strong>ShareGPT-Mix</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>NQ Synthetic</strong>:</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide19.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>For the <strong>ShareGPT-Mix</strong> dataset which includes three sources:</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide20.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p><em>Note: the paper above presents the data using frequency with too few data points, and the numbers in the table don&rsquo;t seem to make sense (e.g., no way to get 31% out of 50 queries).</em></p>
<p>Using the two datasets, the authors look into two research questions &mdash;<br>
<em>How does model imitation improve as we</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Scale the data</strong>: Increase the amount of imitation data (including fine-tuning with different sized data subsets)</li>
<li><strong>Scale the model</strong>: Vary the capabilities of the underlying base model (they used the parameters in the model used as a proxy for base-model quality, regardless of the architecture)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the experiment setup:</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide22.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>The authors use Amazon Mturk using ChatGPT versus Imitation models ($15 an hour and assume that having that will help the quality of annotations). They also used GPT-4 to evalute both.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide23.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>For the preference evalution (Figure below):</p>
<ul>
<li>(Left graph) Over 85% of responses were prefered by the human at same rate or over at ChatGPT. However, more imitation data won&rsquo;t close the gap, as according to the x-axis.</li>
<li>(Middle graph) However, more imitation data can cause decrease of accuracy.</li>
<li>(Right graph) For the number of parameters, the larger base model leads to the better performance.
They thus concluded that rather than fine-tuning on more imitation data, the best way to improve model capabilities is still to improve the base capabilities, rather than the fine tuning process on the imitation data.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide24.png" alt="" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>GPT-4 findings are similar to the human preferences that more imitation data doesn&rsquo;t close the gap and a larger model will contribute to better performance.</p>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/day1/Slide25.png" alt="" width="85%">

<p>They found little improvement with increasing amount of imitation data and size of imitation LM.</p>

<p>Most people in our class agree that there should be no legal concern for researchers and companies to reverse engineer other models via immitating. Professor also proposed another idea that tech companies like OpenAI relies heavily on public-accessible training data from the internet, which weaken the argument that companies have the right to exclusively possess the whole model.</p>

<p><em>Instruction tuning</em> is a technique that allows pre-trained language models to learn from input (natural language descriptions of the task) and response pairs. The goal is to train the model to generate the correct output given a specific input and instruction.</p>
<p>{&ldquo;instruction&rdquo;: &ldquo;Arrange the words in the given sentence to form a grammatically correct sentence.&rdquo;,

<p>&ldquo;Model imitation is a false promise&rdquo; since &ldquo;broadly matching ChatGPT using purely imitation would require:</p>
<ol>
<li>a concerted effort to collect enormous imitation datasets</li>
<li>far more diverse and higher quality imitation data than is currently available.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Simple instructions with limited diversity: Using an initial set of prompts to incite the LFM to produce new instructions. Any low-quality or overly similar responses are then removed, and the remaining instructions are reintegrated into the task pool for further iterations.</li>
<li>Query complexity: Existing methods are limited in their ability to handle complex queries that require sophisticated reasoning. This is because they rely on simple prompts that do not capture the full complexity of the task.</li>
<li>Data scaling: Existing methods require large amounts of high-quality data to achieve good performance. However, collecting such data is often difficult and time-consuming.</li>

<h3 id="what-is-orca">What is Orca</h3>
<p>Orca, a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4, including explanation traces, step-by-step thought processes, and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT.</p>
<h3 id="explanation-tuning">Explanation Tuning</h3>
<p>The authors augment ‚ü®query, response‚ü© pairs with detailed responses from GPT-4 that explain the reasoning process of the teacher as it generates the response. These provide the student with additional signals for learning. They leverage system instructions (e.g.., explain like I‚Äôm five, think step-by-step and justify your response, etc.) to elicit such explanations. This is in contrast to instruction tuning, which only uses the prompt and the LFM response for learning, providing little opportunity for mimicking the LFM‚Äôs ‚Äúthought‚Äù process.</p>

<p>We are going to look at two important research questions using two of the research papers:
(1) What types of data are beneficial to the models? ‚Äì Using the research paper, LIMA: Less is more for Alignment
(2) What are the consequences of low-quality data for the models? ‚Äì Using the research paper, The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</p>

<p>The authors curated a diverse set of training prompts, selecting 750 top questions from community forums and complementing them with 250 manually crafted examples of prompts and responses. They prioritized <em>quality</em>, <em>diversity</em>, and <em>uniformity</em> in their selection process, all while utilizing a smaller dataset. To evaluate performance, LIMA was benchmarked against state-of-the-art language models using a set of 300 challenging test prompts.</p>

<p>The left side showcases the outcomes of a human-based evaluation, comparing LIMA‚Äôs performance across various model sizes. Meanwhile, the right side employs GPT-4 for evaluation purposes. In the comparisons with the first two language models, LIMA emerges as the victor. Notably, it‚Äôs interesting to observe that LIMA secures a 19% win rate against GPT-4, even when GPT-4 itself is utilized as the evaluator.</p>

<p>They also evaluated LIMA&rsquo;s performance in terms of out-of-distribution scenarios and robustness. LIMA safely addressed 80% of the sensitive prompts presented to it. Regarding responses to out-of-distribution inputs, LIMA performed exceptionally well.</p>

<p>In the concluding series of experiments, the research team delved into how the diversity of the test data influences LIMA.</p>
<p>They observed that the filtered Stack Exchange dataset exhibited both diversity and high-quality responses. In contrast, the unfiltered Stack Exchange dataset, while diverse, lacked in quality. On the other hand, wikiHow provided high-quality responses specifically to ‚Äúhow to‚Äù prompts. LIMA showcased impressive performance when dealing with datasets that were both highly diverse and of high quality.</p>
<p>The authors also explored the effects of data volume, with their findings illustrated in the right figure above. Interestingly, they noted that the quantity of data did not exert any noticeable impact on the quality of the generated content.</p>

<p>This paper discusses about model collapse, which is a degenerative process where the model no longer remembers the underlying true distribution. This mainly happens with data where the probability of occurrence is low.</p>

<h2 id="heading-2"></h2>
<h2 id="causes-for-model-collapse">Causes for model collapse</h2>
<p>The two main causes for the model collapse are: (i) Statistical approximation error that occurs as the number of samples are finite, and (ii) Functional approximation error that occurs due to the function approximators being not expressive enough.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-formulation-of-model-collapse">Mathematical formulation of model collapse</h2>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week10/Picture12.png" alt="Mathematical formulation of model collapse" width="85%">
</div>
</center>
<p>Here, the model collapse is expressed through mathematical terms, providing a comprehensive overview of the feedback mechanism involved in the learning process.</p>
<p>Initially, the data are presumed to be meticulously curated by humans, ensuring a pristine starting point. Following this, Model 0 undergoes training, and subsequently, data are sampled from it. At stage n in the process, the data collected from step n - 1 are incorporated into the overall dataset. This comprehensive dataset is then utilized to train Model n.</p>
<p>Ideally, when Monte Carlo sampling is employed to obtain data, the resultant dataset should statistically align closely with the original, assuming that the fitting and sampling procedures are executed flawlessly. This entire procedure mirrors the real-world scenario witnessed on the Internet, where data generated by models become increasingly prevalent and integrated into subsequent learning and development cycles. This creates a continuous feedback loop, where model-generated data are perpetually fed back into the system, influencing future iterations and their capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="theoretical-analysis">Theoretical Analysis</h2>
<p>The following four slides delve into a theoretical analysis of both discrete and continuous distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Discrete Distribution:</strong>
In scenarios where a discrete distribution is under consideration, events with low probabilities tend to degenerate when the sample size is finite. As the number of time steps advances towards infinity, the distribution converges towards a delta distribution. This phenomenon results in the preservation of only the events with high probabilities, while those less likely start to fade away.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous Distribution:</strong>
Assuming the initial distribution to be a Gaussian distribution, the distribution of Xji is analyzed. The resulting distribution follows a variance-gamma distribution, showcasing a divergence from the initial Gaussian form. When Mi = M, the variance‚Äôs difference exhibits a linear growth with respect to n. This indicates that as we proceed through time steps or iterations, the divergence from the initial distribution becomes more pronounced. To quantify the exact extent of divergence between distributions, the Wasserstein-2 distance is employed. This measure provides a precise way to understand how far apart the distributions have moved from each other. The analysis reveals that in order to maintain a finite distance as indicated by the Wasserstein-2 measure, Mi must increase at a rate that is super-linear with respect to n.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> this result didn&rsquo;t make sense to anyone in the seminar. It seems to contradict the intuition (the variance should go to zero as <em>n</em> increases instead of increasing). Either something is wrong with the set up, or this is measuring something different from what we expect.</p>

<p>The following two slides provides steps to estimate mean and variance of general distributions other than one-dimensional Gaussian. They derive a lower bound on the expected value of the distance between the true distribution and the approximated distribution at step $n+1$, which represents the risk that occurs due to finite sampling.</p>
<p>The takeaway of the lower bound is that the sampling rate needs to increase superlinearly to make an accurate end distribution approximation.</p>

<p>To evaluate the performance of GMM, we can visualize the progression of GMM fitting process over time. From the figure, we can see within 50 iterations of re-sampling, the underlying distribution is mis-perceived, and the performance worsens over time.</p>

<p>As before, an autoencoder is trained on an original data source, which later will be sampled. Figure 9 on the left
shows an example of generated data. Again, over a number of generations, the representation has very little resemblance of the original classes learned from data. This implies that longer generation leads to worse quality, as much more information will be lost. We can see from Figure 8 (below) that as with single-dimensional Gaussians, tails disappear over time and all of the density shifts towards the mean.</p>

<p>To assess model collapse in Large Language Models (LLMs), given the high computational cost of training, the authors opted to fine-tune an available pre-trained open-source LLM. In this context, as the generations progress, models tend
to produce more sequences that the original model would produce with the higher likelihood.</p>
<p>This phenomenon closely resembles observations made in the context of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where over successive generations, models begin to produce samples that are more likely according to the original model&rsquo;s probabilities.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the generated data exhibits significantly longer tails, indicating that certain data points are generated that would never have been produced by the original model. These anomalies represent errors that accumulate as a result of the generational learning process.</p>

<p>Q1.
The class discussed the purpose of generating synthetic data. It seems unnecessary to use synthetic data to train on styles, as it can be achieved easily based on the experiments. However, for more complicated tasks that involves reasoning, it might require more human-in-the-loop to validate the correctness of the synthetic data.</p>
<p>Q2.
The class discussion focuses on the significance of domain knowledge in the context of alignment tasks. When dealing with a high-quality domain-specific dataset that includes a golden standard, fine-tuning emerges as a preferable approach for alignment tasks. Conversely, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) seems to be more suitable for general use cases that aim to align with human preferences. Additionally, we explore the potential of leveraging answers obtained through chain-of-thought prompting for the purpose of fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Q3.
The tail of a distribution typically contains rare events or extreme values that occur with very low probability. These events may be outliers, anomalies, or extreme observations that are unusual compared to the majority of data points. For example, in a financial dataset, the tail might represent extreme market fluctuations, such as a stock market crash.</p>
<p>Q4.
This is an open-ended question. One possible reason is that while fine-tuning with generated data mix the original data with the generated data, this augmentation can introduce novel, synthetic examples that the model hasn&rsquo;t seen in the original data. These new examples can extend the tail of the distribution by including previously unseen rare or extreme cases.</p>

<p>Based on the Figure 1 from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206">LIMA</a> paper, using high quality examples to fine-tune LLMs outperforms DaVinci003 (with RLHF). What are the pros and cons, usage scenarios of each method?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are lots of papers using LLMs to generate synthetic data for data augmentation and show improvement over multiple tasks, what do you think is an important factor when sampling synthetic data generated from LLMs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493">The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</a>, the authors discuss how training with generation data affects the approximation for the tail of the true data distribution. Namely, for training GMM/VAEs, the tail of the true distribution will disappear in the estimated distribution (Figure 8). On the other hand, when fine-tuning large language models with generation data, the estimator will have a much longer tail (Figure 10). What do you think causes such a difference? In the real world, what does the tail of a distribution represent and how do you think this phenomenon impacts practical applications?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493">The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget</a>, the authors rely on several assumptions to support their arguments. How strong those assumptions are and do you think these assumptions limit its applicability to broader contexts?</p>

<h3 id="definition-of-interpretability">Definition of Interpretability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interpretability in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning refers to the <strong>extent to which a model&rsquo;s decisions, predictions, or internal workings can be understood and explained by humans</strong>. It&rsquo;s the degree to which a model&rsquo;s behavior can be made transparent, comprehensible, and meaningful to users, stakeholders, or domain experts.</li>
<li>In concept-based interpretability, the focus is on <strong>explaining the model&rsquo;s decisions in terms of high-level concepts or features</strong> that make sense to humans. This approach seeks to relate model behavior to intuitive, domain-specific, or abstract concepts. For example, in a medical diagnosis model, concept-based interpretability might explain that a decision was made because certain symptoms or biomarkers were present.</li>
<li>Mechanistic-based interpretability aims to provide a detailed understanding of how the model makes decisions. This approach delves into the <strong>inner workings of the model</strong>, explaining the role of individual features, weights, and computations. For instance, in a deep learning model, mechanistic interpretability might involve explaining the contributions of specific layers in the decision process.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-is-interpretability-important">Why is interpretability important?</h3>
<p>Interpretability is important because it builds trust, aids in debugging, and is essential in applications where the consequences of AI decisions are significant, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how the model makes the decision.</li>
<li>Analyze whether there are biases or shortcuts that a model is taking during application.</li>
<li>When dealing with human-in-the-loop systems, interpretability enables humans to work collaboratively with AI, leveraging their complementary strengths to achieve better outcomes.</li>

    <p>Attention plays a pivotal role in numerous applications, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). For instance, the choice of a specific word, along with the assigned weight, signifies a correlation between that weight and the decision made.</p>
    <p>In NLP, understanding which words or elements are emphasized, and to what extent (indicated by their respective weights), is crucial. This emphasis often sheds light on the correlation between the input data and the model's decision-making process. Attention-based explainers serve as valuable tools in dissecting and interpreting these correlations, offering insights into how decisions are derived in NLP models.</p>

<p>Group 1: Human interpretability features are essential. For instance, in the application of AI in drug design, an AI model alters a molecule from a non-drug variant to its drug counterpart. Presently, the predominant approach involves creating a black-box model that transforms one molecule into its drug form, contributing to a lack of credibility in the process. For example, a doctor unfamiliar with deep learning cannot comprehend the inner workings of the model that facilitates the conversion of regular molecules into drugs, making it challenging to ensure the safety, efficacy, and trustworthiness of the AI-driven drug design without transparent and interpretable models.</p>
<p>Group 2: A general observation we&rsquo;ve noted is that the requirements or metrics for Explainable AI (XAI) significantly depend on the intended purpose of the tool. For instance, the explanations provided for AI researchers and end users are likely to differ due to their distinct focuses. On the other hand, there is a risk of amplifying confirmation bias if we anticipate XAI to explain phenomena in alignment with human beliefs. To truly understand why a model performs effectively, it might be necessary to set aside human biases and preconceived notions, enabling an unbiased exploration of how the model achieves its performance.</p>
<p>Group 3: Currently, there are still lots of difficulties and problems in using XAI tools in general. For example, methods such as LIME and SHAP always need a lot computation and don‚Äôt work well on complex large models. Besides, we lack ground-truth explanations and therefore, we don‚Äôt know whether the learned explanations are useful or not. Our suggestions for solving those problems and also issues mentioned by other groups are: 1) Approximating the complicate model to some simple model 2) Build self-explainable models 3) Combine different metrics and XAI tools.</p>

    <p>The critical point here underscores the necessity of task-specific techniques, which may seem self-explanatory‚Äîhow can general principles apply without a specific context? Even then, this assumption is not necessarily guaranteed.</p>
    <p>One of the primary challenges between the current state of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and potentially valuable XAI methods is the absence of a method-task link. Ensuring the usability and reliability of an explanation in a particular task requires a deeper connection. This could either involve anchoring explanations in theory directly aligned with the task's requirements or creating task-inspired explanations and subsequently empirically evaluating them within the targeted application.</p>

There are several ways SoLU is designed to reduce polysemanticity:

        <li>Lateral inhibition, approximate sparsity and superlinearity can be achieved by changing the MLP activation function.</li>
        <li>Instead of sigmoid in GeLU, they use softmax, and drop the constant (1.7).</li>
        <li>However, this led to a massive drop in performance, so they added an extra LayerNorm after SoLU.</li>
        <li>The intuition was that it might fix issues with activation scale and improve optimization.</li>

    <p>When SoLU is applied on a vector of large and small values (4, 1, 4, 1), the large values will suppress smaller values. Large basis aligned vectors e.g. (4, 0, 0, 0) are preserved. A feature spread across many dimensions (1, 1, 1, 1) will be suppressed to a smaller magnitude.

    <p>They assessed their model's performance on a variety of datasets, including Lambada, OpenBookQA, ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, TriviaQA, and arithmetic datasets, and the results are displayed in Figure 2.

    <p>The purpose of this paper is to clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of a sparse autoencoder in achieving two main objectives: extracting understandable features from superposition and facilitating basic circuit analysis. Specifically, the authors achieve this by using a one-layer transformer with a 512-neuron MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) layer. They break down the activations of the MLP into features that are relatively easy to interpret by training sparse autoencoders on the MLP activations obtained from a massive dataset comprising 8 billion data points. These autoencoders have varying expansion factors, ranging from 1√ó(resulting in 512 features) to 256√ó(resulting in 131,072 features).</p>

    <p>Sparse autoencoders use several techniques and strategies to extract interpretable features from neural network activations:
      <ol>
        <li>MSE Loss for Avoiding Polysemanticity: Emphasizes using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss instead of cross-entropy loss to prevent the overloading of features.</li>
        <li>Larger Internal Dimension: Advocates for a larger number of internal features within the autoencoder to create an overcomplete set of features.</li>
        <li>L1 Penalty: Applies an L1 penalty on the internal features to encourage sparsity within the representation.</li>
        <li>Input Bias: Introduces an approach of adding an input bias to the representations in autoencoders, which demonstrates a significant boost in performance for the models used in toy examples.</li>

<p>The purpose of sparse autoencoders is to extract meaningful features from neural network activations. To avhice a good decomposition, where the features extracted should be interpretable and able to describe the activations' context requires the ability to describe activations, interpret downstream effects of changes, and cover a significant portion of functionality within the data.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Activation Sampling Bias</strong>: In previous evaluations, there was a bias due to just considering the top-activation neurons which might inaccurately appear monosemantic due to their higher activations. To mitigate this bias, the approach involves sampling uniformly across all possible activations for each given feature.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of Interpretable Features:</strong> The authors used an evaluation process where human-based assessments are used to determine the interpretability of the features extracted.

<p>The sparse autoencoder technique in focus can explain up to 80% of the loss. This means that by replacing activated neurons with reconstructions, 80% of the original model&rsquo;s loss can be accounted for without altering the model. Notably, there is a high correlation (Spearman correlation around 0.7) between independent features of two models sharing the same architecture but having different random initializations.</p>
<p>Considering these evaluation findings, the class divided into three groups to discuss specific questions related to the interpretability of features.</p>
<p>One group noted a common discrepancy between the expectations from
language models and humans. Language models are often expected to
perform at superhuman or domain expert levels, while their
capabilities might align more closely with those of a standard
human. The use of a general-purpose language model for features
requiring domain expertise was seen as a potential issue, as the
model&rsquo;s interpretation might lack the required domain-specific
knowledge.</p>
<p>The group also shared their discussion about the possibility that
language models might &lsquo;hallucinate&rsquo; interpretations for given
features, possibly creating false correlations or interpretations that
do not necessarily exist within the data. Human evaluators might also
introduce subconscious biases or look for patterns without having the
necessary domain expertise, potentially affecting the interpretability
findings. Another key point they raised was about the intended
audience for interpretability. They discussed that interpretability
work from the language models might primarily target researchers,
specifically computer science researchers who are involved in
developing and assessing models, rather than end-users of these models
in practical applications.</p>
<p>The second group highlighted the multifaceted nature of the variance
observed in models designed to find interpretable features. It
primarily attributed this variability to stochastic elements in the
learning process, the order and sequence of data during training, and
the diverse interpretations resulting from these variations, which may
lead to equally interpretable yet different feature sets.</p>
<p>The final group emphasized the potential acceptability of the unexplained 20% in certain contexts, underscoring the value in correctly interpreting the majority of the content. Additionally, they noted the potential nuances within the unexplained portion, distinguishing between varying reasons for lack of interpretability within that portion.</p>

The training of three different versions of autoencoders with increasing sizes of the internal representation were described, leading to more sparsity in interpretable features. They analogized a dictionary learning algorithm to an unlimited number of interpretable features, Even with varied model semantics, a structured superposition of concepts emerges in the learning process. 
<p>By feature clustering and splitting, this splitting of features leads to more fine-grained interpretations, where a single concept or feature might bifurcate into multiple similar but distinct interpretable features. These findings may have benefits beyond one-layer transformers, suggesting the possibility of applying this technique to larger transformers or models.</p>

The summary underscores the potential and limitations of both architectural changes aimed at controlling polysemanticity and the potential for post-learning techniques, but so far only partially demonstrated for a simple  1-layer transformer. 
<p>Post-learning interpretation seems more practical for now than
adapting existing training techniques for interpretability, which would require larger changes to current practices.</p> </td> </table></p>

<h2 id="the-early-days-of-machine-translation">The Early Days of Machine Translation</h2>
<p>The birth of machine translation can be traced back to 1933 with the work of George Artsrouni and Petr Smirnov-Troyanskii. Artsrouni developed an automatic multilingual word lookup, which can be viewed as a precursor to the modern digital dictionary. Smirnov-Troyanskii conceptualized a machine translation process where humans and machines work together, with different steps encoded by humans and others by the machine.</p>
<h2 id="different-generations-of-machine-translation-approaches">Different Generations of Machine Translation Approaches</h2>
<p>Machine translation approaches can be categorized into three primary generations, each having its unique characteristics and methodologies.</p>
<h3 id="first-generation-direct-translation">First Generation: Direct Translation</h3>
<p>The MT system is designed in all details specifically for one particular pair of languages, e.g. Russian as the language of the original texts, the source language, and English as the language of the translated texts, the target language. Translation is direct from the source language (SL) text to the target language (TL) text;Typically, systems consist of a large bilingual dictionary and a single monolithic program for analyzing and generating texts; such &lsquo;direct translation&rsquo; systems are necessarily bilingual and unidirectional.</p>

</center>
<h3 id="second-generation-interlingua-and-transfer-approach">Second Generation: Interlingua and Transfer Approach</h3>
<p>The Interlingua approach proposed the use of a universal semantic representation, known as Interlingua, between the source and target languages. This approach offered the advantage of being multilingual, where it was easy to swap source languages, thus reducing the number of models needed.
In contrast, the Transfer approach used abstract representations of both the source and target languages. This approach required an extensive collection of dictionaries, grammar rules, and language structure rules, including syntax, morphology, and possibly semantics.</p>
<h3 id="third-generation-statistical-methods">Third Generation: Statistical Methods</h3>
<p>The third generation of MT brought a significant shift by introducing statistical methods. This generation marked a transition from rule-based methods to learning-based methods, leveraging data and probability to guide translation.</p>

<h2 id="heading-2"></h2>
<p>In the 1950s, theory-driven machine translation began, heavily influenced by linguistics and computer science, with a primary focus on Russian-English and English-Russian translation and the use of some statistical methods.</p>
<p>The 1960s introduced challenges in representing semantics and the &ldquo;encoder-decoder&rdquo; structure, a foundational concept in modern neural machine translation.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the field transitioned from interlingua to transfer methods and explored AI concepts.</p>
<p>The 1980s brought multilingual MT systems, revisiting interlingua methods and advancing semantic representations.</p>
<p>The 1990s witnessed a significant shift from rule-based methods to &ldquo;corpus-based&rdquo; and &ldquo;example-based&rdquo; approaches, emphasizing data-driven methods in machine translation. It also marked the initial use of neural networks and the integration of machine translation with speech recognition, opening new horizons in the field.</p>
<h1 id="neural-machine-translation">Neural Machine Translation</h1>
<p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) uses neural network models to develop a statistical model for machine translation. Unlike traditional phrase-based translation systems that comprise multiple small sub-components tuned separately, NMT attempts to build and train a singular, large neural network that reads a sentence and outputs the correct translation.</p>
<h2 id="early-models">Early Models</h2>
<h3 id="recurrent-neural-network-rnn">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</h3>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_5.png" alt="" width="70%">
</div>
</center>
<p>RNNs process sequential data one element at a time, maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous elements to inform future predictions or classifications. In the image above, &lsquo;x&rsquo; represents individual elements from sequential data, &lsquo;A&rsquo; represents the Neural Network, and &lsquo;h&rsquo; signifies the hidden layer. At each time step, it processes sequential data step-by-step.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_6.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>The image above illustrates how RNN works for language translation. To translate a sentence like &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; from English to French using an RNN Encoder-Decoder, the English input is initially encoded through an Encoder. Subsequently, the Decoder generates the French output word by word. This sequential process results in the French translation, such as &lsquo;Comment allez vous ?,&rsquo; from the English input.</p>
<p>However, RNNs have a limitation in handling long-term dependencies. When dealing with a large amount of data, RNNs may struggle to memorize it all.</p>
<p>One solution to this limitation is Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), a specific type of RNN designed to capture long-term dependencies. LSTMs incorporate forget, input, and output gates that regulate the flow of information within the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forget gate determines whether to retain or discard certain information.</li>
<li>The input gate quantifies the significance of new information introduced.</li>
<li>The output gate determines what information should be produced.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_7.png" alt="" width="70%">
</div>
</center>
<p>Simultaneously, the attention mechanism stands as a pivotal development in NMT. It grants the decoder access to all hidden states from the encoder, enabling the network to selectively focus on different segments of the input sequence during each step of output generation. This enhances the model&rsquo;s ability to handle long sentences and complex dependencies. The model gains access to all inputs through the use of bidirectional RNNs. Additionally, the prediction of the next word depends on the weighted combination of these hidden states.</p>
<div class="slide">

<h3 id="transformer-model">Transformer Model</h3>
<p>The Transformer model is a type of neural network architecture primarily used in the field of natural language processing.</p>
<p><strong>Key Advantage:</strong>
Unlike models that process sentences sequentially, a Transformer processes the whole sentence at once, which can lead to faster computation and the ability to parallelize the process.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_9.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>In the self-attention mechanism, a given batched input X is linearly projected into three distinct representations: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The attention score is computed using Q and K. If padding is applied, all padding positions are masked in the attention score.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Head Attention</strong>
In a Transformer model, Q, K, and V are divided into multiple splits, and each split is passed into a separate head, termed as a &ldquo;multi-head&rdquo; attention system. Each head computes its attention independently, and all attention results are then concatenated, effectively reversing the split operation.
The multi-head attention mechanism enables each head to learn different aspects of the meanings of each word in relation to other words in the sequence. This allows the Transformer model to capture richer interpretations of the sequence.</p>

<p><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>General Trend</strong>: For all three models, as the amount of training data increases, the BLEU score (indicative of translation quality) also increases. This suggests that having more training data generally leads to better translation performance.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Performance</strong>: The Phrase-Based with Big LM model consistently outperforms the other two models across different corpus sizes. The Neural model (NMT) starts off better than the simple Phrase-Based model for smaller corpus sizes but tends to converge with the Phrase-Based model as the corpus size grows.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_14.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>NMT provides superior performance when translating words that are infrequent (rarely used) or completely untrained (words not seen during the training process). This could suggest that NMT is more adaptable and flexible in handling diverse vocabulary than SMT.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_15.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>While NMT excels at translating shorter sentences, SMT appears to be more effective for much longer sentences. This might indicate that the statistical approach of SMT is better equipped to handle the complexities and nuances of longer sentence structures.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_16.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>From this data, it can be inferred that the choice of word alignment method can influence the accuracy and quality of translations. Different language pairs also exhibit varying levels of alignment match and probability, suggesting that the effectiveness of these methods can vary based on the languages in question.</p>
<div class="slide">

<p>Beam search is a heuristic search strategy that systematically expands the most promising nodes in a tree-like structure to improve sequence prediction results. The visual representation effectively demonstrates the branching and exploration inherent in the beam search algorithm.</p>
<div class="slide">

<p>While all these issues are crucial, most of the class considered &ldquo;Domain adaptation/mismatch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amount of training data&rdquo; to be the most pressing. As the digital world grows and diversifies, machine translation tools will be exposed to an ever-increasing array of content types. Ensuring that these tools can adapt to various domains and are trained on representative datasets will be key to their effectiveness and relevance.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_19.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>Domain adaptation in NMT focuses on ensuring translation accuracy for specialized content, like medical or legal texts, given the varied data distribution between training and target domains. Additionally, the infrequent occurrence of specific words, notably proper nouns, in training data can result in mistranslations. Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for enhancing NMT&rsquo;s accuracy and applicability in different contexts.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_20.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>While both LLM and NMT are rooted in deep learning and can comprehend linguistic context, they differ in their primary objectives, training datasets, and architecture. LLMs are versatile and can handle diverse language tasks beyond just translation, while NMTs are specialized for translating between two languages.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_21.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>The comparison highlights the translation performance debate between LLMs and MT models. While both commercial and open-source MTs are valuable, LLMs fine-tuned with general-purpose instructions often excel. The data emphasizes the significance of scale and fine-tuning in LLM effectiveness.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_22.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>The diagrams depict the intricate processes by which Large Language Models (LLMs) engage in translation tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Content Source</strong>:
The initial content that needs translation can come in various formats, including PDFs, Office documents, and even video.</p>
<p><strong>Automated TM Management</strong>:
This is an automated system for managing &lsquo;Translation Memories&rsquo; (TM). Translation memories store previously translated segments of text to ensure consistent translations and speed up the translation process in future tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-translation</strong>:
The untranslated content is matched against a Vector Database (DB) to identify similar contexts or content. The system then uses the K-nearest neighbours method to reference the closest matches.
Relevant training data is extracted to fine-tune the model for a specific task or context.
The model undergoes &lsquo;Prompt Engineering Fine-Tuning&rsquo; (PEFT) using the LoRA method, enhancing its precision for specific tasks or contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Hyper-personalized MT engine</strong>:
Specific prompts are crafted for the content and its context.
The model learns in the given prompt&rsquo;s context, further enhancing translation accuracy.
The LLM API allows other systems or processes to interact seamlessly with the LLM.
The LLM works in tandem with the LoRA module, adding an extra layer of functionality and precision to the translation process.</p>
<p><strong>Human Interaction</strong>:
Even with advanced models, there&rsquo;s a phase where human experts intervene, either for post-editing or proofreading, ensuring the final content adheres to the highest standards.</p>
<p><strong>Top Quality MT Output</strong>:
After all these stages, the translation process culminates in producing content of the highest caliber, ensuring accuracy and context preservation.</p>
<p>Both diagrams underscore a blend of automation, advanced modeling, and human expertise to achieve top-notch translations.</p>

<p><strong>Database of Translated Texts</strong>: The cluster of pages symbolizes a collection of previously translated documents stored for reference.</p>
<p><strong>Search Process</strong>: The magnifying glass indicates the process of searching within the database to find a matching or similar translation.</p>
<p><strong>User Interaction</strong>: The silhouette represents a user or translator interacting with the translation memory system.</p>
<p><strong>Original Content (A)</strong>: The page with the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; signifies source content awaiting translation. The highlighted segments on this page denote the parts of the text that have matching translations in the memory.</p>
<p><strong>Translated Content (X)</strong>: The page with the symbol &ldquo;X&rdquo; showcases the result after using the translation memory. The highlighted segments indicate the portions of the content retrieved from the memory, ensuring consistency and saving time.</p>
<p><strong>Savings/Cost-Efficiency</strong>: The stack of coins symbolizes the financial advantage or savings gained from using translation memory, reaffirming the caption that states &ldquo;Translation memory is the customer&rsquo;s moneybox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This visual displays how Translation Memory systems improve efficiency and consistency in translation tasks by reusing previously translated segments.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_24.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>The diagram illustrates three fine-tuning methodologies for neural networks:</p>
<p><strong>Classic</strong>: Involves iterative corrections based on errors.</p>
<p><strong>Freeze</strong>: Retains the original weights and makes separate, task-specific adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation)</strong>: Directly integrates with pre-trained models for efficient task-specific adaptations without extensive error corrections.</p>
<p>In essence, while the classic method emphasizes error corrections, the freeze approach preserves foundational knowledge, and LoRA offers a streamlined adaptation process. The choice among them hinges on the task and desired model refinement.</p>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_25.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>Benefits related to machine translation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stylized</strong>: LLMs can adapt to different translation styles, such as formal, informal, or even regional variations.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong>: They can provide real-time translations during interactive sessions, such as live chats.</li>
<li><strong>TM based</strong>: LLMs can utilize Translation Memory to ensure consistency across large documents or series of documents, improving translation quality by leveraging prior translations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week8/slide_26.png" alt="">
</div>
<p><strong>Evolution of MT Techniques</strong>:
Traditional Machine Translation has evolved to incorporate more sophisticated methods, with the advent of GPT models introducing new paradigms.</p>
<p><strong>Stylized MT</strong>:
Goes beyond standard translation by adapting to specific styles or tones, like literature or marketing.
Despite Neural Machine Translation (NMT) having capabilities for style transfer, its potential is often limited by data availability. LLMs like GPT can overcome this using zero-shot prompts.</p>
<p><strong>Interactive MT</strong>:
Represents a shift towards more user-centric translation methods.
By actively involving the user in the translation process and gathering their feedback, it ensures translations are more contextually accurate and meet specific requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Translation Memory-based MT</strong>:
Aims to improve translation efficiency by referencing past translations.
LLMs bring an added advantage by using past translations not just for replication but as context-rich prompts to guide the current translation process.</p>
<p><strong>Emergence of New Paradigms &amp; Concerns</strong>:
The integration of LLMs in MT introduces new evaluation methodologies.
However, this also raises potential privacy concerns, emphasizing the importance of data ethics in AI-driven translation.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-modality in MT</strong>:
Suggests a future direction where translations aren&rsquo;t just based on text but incorporate multiple forms of data, enriching the translation process.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency on LLMs</strong>:
The consistent reference to GPT models across various MT applications indicates the growing influence and reliance on LLMs in modern translation efforts.</p>
<p>The transformative role of LLMs in reshaping machine translation, offering enhanced accuracy, versatility, and user engagement.</p>
<p>The activity showcases the challenges and complexities of machine translation. While tools like DeepL can offer rapid translations, they may sometimes miss cultural, contextual, or idiomatic nuances present in human translations. This is especially relevant for movie dialogues where context and tone play crucial roles.
<strong>Can MT outperform human translation?</strong>
MT can be faster and efficient for large-scale tasks, but human translation excels in capturing nuance, cultural context, and idiomatic expressions.</p>
<p><strong>What are other challenges that can&rsquo;t be solved by MT?</strong>
MT struggles with cultural nuances, idioms, historical context, and emotional undertones which humans can naturally grasp.</p>
<p><strong>How can HT and MT interact for better Language Translation?</strong>
A hybrid approach, combining MT&rsquo;s speed and efficiency with HT&rsquo;s contextual understanding, can lead to more accurate and nuanced translations.</p>

<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/A.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Today's topic is how to utilize generative adversarial networks to create fake images and how to identify the images generated by these models.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/B.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a revolutionary deep learning framework that pits two neural networks against each other in a creative showdown. One network, the generator, strives to produce realistic data, such as images or text, while the other, the discriminator, aims to differentiate between genuine and generated data. Through a continuous feedback loop, GANs refine their abilities, leading to the generation of increasingly convincing and high-quality content.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/C.JPG" alt="">
  <p>To ensure students have a better understanding of GANs. The leading team held a ‚ÄúGAN Auction Game‚Äù to simulate the generating and predicting process of the generator and discriminator in GAN. In this game, students are divided into two groups (Group 1 and Group 2). Group 1 will provide three items (e.g. the name of a place) while Group 2 tries to identify whether the items provided are real or fake.
<p>The game captures the training process of GANs where the generator first proposes certain contents (e.g. images or contexts) and the discriminator is trained to distinguish real from generated (fake) content.</p>
<p>If the generator successfully creates contents that fools the discriminator, it will receive a high reward for further tuning. On the other hand, if the discriminator correctly identifies the content created by the generator it receives a reward.</p>
<p>This iterative training process is illustrated by the figures below.</p></p>

<h2 id="heading-2"></h2>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/G.JPG" alt="">
  <p>Formally, the training process can be modeled as a two-player zero-sum game by conducting min-max optimization on the objective function.A Nash equilibrium will be established between generator and discriminator.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/H.JPG" alt="">
</div>
<h1 id="heading-3"></h1>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/I.JPG" alt="">
  <p>
<p>For a system that only has generators and discriminators, it is hard to tell whether they are doing well because there are many bad local optima. Thus, one direct way is to introduce human feedback for evaluating.</p>
<p>For example, we can borrow strategies from Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly employing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). In this method, experts would iteratively rank the generated samples, offering direct reinforcement signals to improve the generator&rsquo;s output. This approach could enhance the realism and semantic alignment of the content created by GANs. However, the RLHF method has its drawbacks, primarily the extensive need for expert involvement, raising concerns about its scalability in larger evaluations.</p>
<p>An alternative could be the inclusion of non-expert users, offering a broader range of feedback. Crowdsourcing and user studies are suggested as methods to understand if the generated content meets the target audience&rsquo;s needs and preferences.</p></p>
<p>For images or tabular data, when the data distribution is roughly known, inception score serves as an useful metric. This score calculates the KL divergence between the conditional class distribution and the marginal class distribution of generated samples. A higher inception score (IS) indicates clearer and more diverse images. However, it doesn't always correlate with human judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">

<h2 id="heading-4"></h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Vanishing/Exploding Gradient: During backpropagation, gradients can shrink (vanish) or grow excessively (explode), disrupting learning. Vanishing gradients stall the network's learning, as parameter updates become negligible. Exploding gradients cause extreme, destabilizing updates, hindering the model's convergence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mode Collapse: GANs can suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces limited, similar samples, failing to represent the data's true diversity. This occurs when the generator exploits the discriminator's weaknesses, concentrating on certain data aspects and neglecting others. It compromises the GAN's objective of generating diverse, realistic samples, indicating a breakdown in adversarial learning.</p>

  <p>A warm-up game is to identify the fake person that is generated by GANs.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/M.JPG" alt="">
  <p>In the above figure, one of the two faces is fake but it is difficult to identify at first glance.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/N.JPG" alt="">
  <p>To successfully identify fake images, there are several methods that either use deep-learning-based models to learn to identify fake samples, or through direct observation by people. The leading team then introduces three interesting methods that enable us to tell the difference. We will revisit these two faces later and now focus on the detailed methods to do general identification.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/O.JPG" alt="">
</div>
<h2 id="heading-6"></h2>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/P.JPG" alt="">
  <p>For example, images generated by GANs tend to contain color artifacts or invisible artifacts that can be identified by deep learning models.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/Q.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The second method is physical-based. Namely, the corneal specular highlights for the real face have strong similarities while those for the GAN-faces are different.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/R.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The third method is physiological-based. Specifically, the pupils for the real eyes have strong circular shapes while the GAN-generated pupils usually have irregular shapes.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/S.JPG" alt="">
  <p>With the help of these methods, we can say that the left woman in the figure we showed before is fake. This can be justified by color artifacts of GAN-image identified from deep learning and her irregular pupils.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/T.JPG" alt="">
  <p>The leading team also believes that these identification methods can be escaped by more advanced image-generating models but new methods will also be proposed accordingly to distinguish images generated by these advanced models. The generation and identification will evolve together.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
  <img src="../images/week7/U.JPG" alt="">
  <p>In summary, generative models such as GANs have fundamentally transformed people's lives, and there remains a substantial amount of future research and development ahead. Some future directions are listed above.</p>

  <p> The presenters asked the class to find criterias to identify an authentic picture of Tom Cruise. In the discussion, several factors were highlighted:
  <ul>
  <li> <i>Posture</i> of the third picture is unnatural.</li>
  <li><i>Foggy background</i> of first picture vs. <i>Realistic background</i> of the second picture</li>
  <li><i>Scale/ratio</i> of head and hand is odd in the third picture</li>
  </ul>
  During the class poll to determine which image appeared authentic, the majority of students voted for the second image, with a few supporting the first, and none voting for the third.

<p>
Surprisingly to the majority of the class, it was revealed that the first image was genuine, while the others were crafted by a TikTok user in creating deep fake content.

  <li> Group 2: Ear detection is only possible when ear is visible. </li>
  <li> Group 3: Dependent on visibility of ear and having a reference image; ability to generalize to other situations, i.e.: smaller sample sizes; you could find an actor whose biometric markers were more similar to the desired image. </li>

  <p> Both the technology and ways to detect deep-fake videos will continue to advance.
However, it requires more than simply trying to generate and identify them.
By using watermarks, deep-fake videos can be distinguished from the source. Furthermore, public education on teaching importance on collecting information from the correct source and further government regulations can be considered. Perhaps the biggest threat from improvements in the quality and ease of creating fake imagery, is that people will lose confidence in all images and assume everything they see is fake.

<h1 id="discussion-questions">Discussion Questions</h1>
<p><strong>For Monday&rsquo;s class:</strong> (as usual, post your response to at least one of these questions, or respond to someone else&rsquo;s response, or post anything you want that is interesting and relevant, before 8:29pm on Sunday, 8 October)</p>
<ol>
<li>How might the application of GANs extend beyond image generation to other domains, such as text, finance, healthcare (or any other domain that you can think of) and what unique challenges might arise in these different domains? How can the GAN framework ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in these applications?</li>
<li>Considering the challenges in evaluating the performance and quality of GANs, how might evaluation metrics or methods be developed to assess the quality, diversity, and realism of the samples generated by GANs in a more robust and reliable manner? Additionally, how might these evaluation methods account for different types of data (e.g., images, text, tabular
etc.) and various application domains?</li>
<li>The authors identify 2 methods of detecting GAN-based images: physical and physiological. Is it possible that we can train a new model to modify a GAN-based image to hide these seemingly obvious flaws, like the reflection and pupil shapes? Will this approach quickly invalidate these two methods?</li>
<li>Do you agree with the authors that deep-learning based methods lack interpretability? Is the visible or invisible patterns detected by DL models really not understandable or explainable?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions for Wednesday&rsquo;s class:</strong> (post response by 8:29pm on Tuesday, 10 October)</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the potential applications for the techniques discussed in the Agarwal and Farid paper beyond deep-fake detection, such as in voice recognition or speaker authentication systems?</li>
<li>How robust are the proposed ear analysis methods to real-world conditions like different head poses, lighting, occlusion by hair?</li>
<li>What are your ideas for other ways to detect deepfakes?</li>
<li>Deepfake detection and generation seems similar to many other &ldquo;arms races&rdquo; between attackers and defenders. How do you see this arms race evolving? Will there be an endpoint with one side clearly winning?</li>

        <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
There are three types of hallucinations according to the ‚ÄúSiren's Song
            in the AI Ocean‚Äù paper:
<ul> <li><i>Input-conflict:</i> This
            subcategory of hallucinations deviates from user
            input.</li> <li><i>Context-conflict:</i>
            Context-conflict hallucinations occur when a model
            generates contradicting information within a response. A
            simple example of this would be replacing someone‚Äôs name
            (ex. Silver) for another name (ex. Stern).</li>
            <li><i>Fact-conflict:</i> This is the most common
            subcategory of hallucination, thus making it the most
            recent focus of research. An example of this could be
            returning the wrong date for a historical event.</li>
            </ul>
<p>In class, there were dissenting opinions about the
definition of hallucination regarding LLMs. One classmate
argued how alignment-based hallucination should not be
considered as part of the discussion scope, as the model
would still be doing what it was intended to be doing
(i.e. aligning with the user and/or aligning with the
trainer).</p>

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2%;">
<i>Group 1</i> focused on "Input-conflict Hallucination". One member narrated a story involving two characters, where one character murdered the other. Contrarily, ChatGPT presented an opposite conclusion. Another member tried to exploit different languages, using two distinct languages that possess similar words.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 2%;">
<i>Group 2</i> concentrated on "Counter-conflict Hallucination". They described four to five fictitious characters, detailing their interrelationships.

<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
For inference, one strategy is to reduce the snowballing of hallucinations by designing a dynamic p-value. The p-value should start off large and shrink as more tokens are generated. Furthermore, introducing new or external knowledge can be done at two different positions: before and after generation.

<br/>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
            Based on evolving trends, the concept of contrastive decoding is introduced. For example, one might ask, "How do we decide between Seattle or Olympia?" When considering the last layer as a mature layer, it is beneficial to contrast the differences between the preceding layers, which can be deemed as premature. For each of these layers, it is possible to calculate the difference between each probability distribution by comparing mature and premature layers, a process that utilizes the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Such an approach permits the amplification of the factual knowledge that the model has acquired, thereby enhancing its output generation.

  <p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
            The model parameters are kept frozen. Instead of directly inputting text into the model, the approach first uses retrieval to search for relevant documents from external sources. The findings from these sources are then concatenated with the original text. Re-ranking results from the retrieval model also provides benefits; the exact perplexities can be referred to in the slide. It has been observed that smaller strides can enhance performance, albeit at the cost of increased runtime. The authors have noticed that the information at the end of a query is typically more relevant for output generation. In general, shorter queries tend to outperform longer ones.

<h2 id="discussion-_based-on-the-sources-of-hallucination-what-methods-can-be-employed-to-mitigate-the-hallucination-issue_h2">Discussion: <em>Based on the sources of hallucination, what methods can be employed to mitigate the hallucination issue?</em></h2></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
    Group 2:
        Discussed two papers from this week's reading which highlighted the use of semantic search and the introduction of external context to aid the model. This approach, while useful for diminishing hallucination, heavily depends on external information, which is not effective in generic cases.
        Further strategies discussed were automated prompt engineering, optimization of user-provided context (noting that extensive contexts can induce hallucination), and using filtering or attention mechanisms to limit the tokens the model processes.
        From the model's perspective, it is beneficial to employ red-teaming, explore corner cases, and pinpoint domains where hallucinations are prevalent.
        Notably, responses can vary for an identical prompt. A proposed solution is to generate multiple responses to the same prompt and amalgamate them, perhaps through a majority voting system, to eliminate low-probability hallucinations.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
    Group 1:
        Discussed the scarcity of alternatives to the current training dataset.
        Like Group 2, they also explored the idea of generating multiple responses but suggested allowing the user to select from the array of choices.
        Another approach discussed was the model admitting uncertainty, stating "I don‚Äôt know", rather than producing a hallucination.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
    Group 3: Addressed inconsistencies in the training data.
        Emphasized the importance of fine-tuning and ensuring the use of contemporary data.
        However, they noted that fine-tuning doesn't ensure exclusion of outdated data.
        It was also advised to source data solely from credible sources.
        An interesting perspective discussed was utilizing a larger model to verify the smaller model's hallucinations. But a caveat arises: How can one ensure the larger model's accuracy? And if the larger model is deemed superior, why not employ it directly?
</p>
<h2 id="discussion-_what-are-the-potential-advantages-of-hallucinations-in-large-language-models-llms_h2">Discussion: <em>What are the potential advantages of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)?</em></h2></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; text-indent: 5%;">
    One advantage discussed was that hallucinations "train" users to not blindly trust the model outputs. If such models are blindly trusted, there is a much greater risk associated with their use.
    If users can conclusively discern, however, that the produced information is fictitious, it could assist in fostering new ideas or fresh perspectives on a given topic.
    Furthermore, while fake data has potential utility in synthetic data generation, there's a pressing need to remain vigilant regarding the accuracy and plausibility of the data produced.

<p>Jingfeng Yang, Hongye Jin, Ruixiang Tang, Xiaotian Han, Qizhang Feng, Haoming Jiang, Bing Yin, Xia Hu. <em>Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Practice: A Survey on ChatGPT and Beyond</em>. April 2023. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13712">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13712</a></p>
<p>This discussion was essential to highlight the distinction between large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuned models. The paper defines LLMs as models trained on large amounts of data without a particular domain of application in mind and fine-tuned models as models trained on some general data in addition to data from a specific domain in which they will perform a particular task. They also highlighted a rule of thumb from the paper that LLMs typically have more than 20 billion parameters whereas fine-tuned models have fewer than 20 billion parameters.</p>
<p>The presenters then discussed how to go about choosing the model that is best for a task when there are so many available. They explored two ways of approaching this problem: one that considers the data, and another that considers the task.</p>
<p>The presenters highlighted three types of data to consider for a task: the pre-training data, the fine-tuning data, and the test data. If there is a model already pre-trained on data that is relevant to the task at hand, that model might be a good choice. In order for a dataset to be conducive to fine-tuning a model, the data must be labeled and that there must be enough of it to sufficiently train the model. Otherwise, training an LLM would be better. The presenters noted, however, that fine-tuned models have been shown to perform better than LLMs on specific tasks when they have sufficient data to train on.</p>
<p>The following Figure 1 shows that fine-tuned models performed better than LLMs after being trained on enough data:</p>

</table>
<p>LLMs and fine-tuned models perform better on different tasks. According to a study from the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13848"><em>Benchmarking Large Language Models for News Summarization</em></a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, LLMs perform better than fine-tuned models on text summarization according to the preferences of human raters. Additionally, LLMs perform better on tasks that require large amounts of knowledge from a variety of domains<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. In machine translation, however, fine-tuned models generally do better than LLMs, although they only do slightly better in low-resource settings<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Additionally, the presenters explained that fine-tuned models and LLMs have similar performance when the task only requires very specific knowledge.</p>
<p>The presenters then posed the following question to the class: ‚ÄúHow could we enhance LLM in the scenario where the required knowledge does not match their learned knowledge?‚Äù The class formed four groups to discuss the question. Each group then shared a summary of what they had discussed:</p>
<p>Group 1: Discussed enhancements in both training and testing. For testing, use intentional prompts to get the knowledge you want from the model. For training, adding more training data, using a knowledge graph to classify knowledge into different clusters for ease of search, and using a plug-in, as mentioned in the GitHub discussion.</p>
<p>Group 2: Advocated for enhancement through the model&rsquo;s ability to retrieve information from external sources and undergo fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Group 3: Emphasized the significance of using more extensive datasets and guiding models through example-based prompts to extract additional knowledge from the available data.</p>
<p>Group 4: Proposed refining model performance through fine-tuning and deliberately specifying the model&rsquo;s role within a chat setting to steer it toward specific tasks.</p>
<p>The presenters also mentioned that LLMs perform arithmetic better as they grow larger and that LLMs are better at commonsense reasoning than fine-tuned models<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-plug-ins">ChatGPT Plug-Ins</h2>
<p>The presenters then moved to a discussion of ChatGPT plug-ins. They established that LLMs are not able to keep up with current knowledge and facts and that they mainly handle text data as opposed to image data, audio, and other data formats. They also explained that while LLMs may be able to generate instructions for a human to follow to complete a task, they are often unable to follow those instructions and complete the tasks themselves. This is where plug-ins come in.</p>
<p>Plug-ins allow LLMs to access data outside of what they have already learned, for example, by searching the web. Plug-ins can enable ChatGPT to search the web (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#browsing">https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#browsing</a>) and write code (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter)">https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter)</a>. They also showed a video of how ChatGPT can use plug-ins from outside OpenAI to complete tasks with specific instructions, namely, finding a restaurant, then a recipe, then calculating the number of calories in the recipe (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#third-party-plugins)">https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#third-party-plugins)</a>.</p>
<p>The class then formed groups and spent 25 minutes designing custom plug-ins. Each group then shared their plug-in with the class:</p>
<p><em>Group 1</em>: Envisioned a plug-in that allows a user to make DIY furniture or buy new furniture by submitting an image of something they would like to make from scratch or buy and returning either a link to a similar piece of furniture or a video/instructions on how to build a piece of furniture similar to the one in their image (Figure 2).</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 2 <b>DIY Furniture Plug-In </b></td>
</table>
<p><em>Group 2</em>: Suggested a plug-in that generates the profile of a fake person with a fake social media account. Essentially, it aimed to create a convincing online persona that would resemble a real person but was entirely fictional. (Such a plug-in, obviously, raises some serious ethical concerns and could be used for some legitimate purposes, but many malign ones!)</p>
<p><em>Group 3</em>: Created a plug-in that uses a person‚Äôs portfolio/resume to match them with different jobs serving as an ultimate career support tool (Figure 3). It assisted users in job search by matching them with relevant job openings, provided tailored preparation materials for interviews, offered resume/portfolio editing guidance, and provided opportunities to expand their professional network. Essentially, it aimed to equip individuals with the tools and resources needed to enhance their career prospects.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 3 <b>Job Hunter Plug-In</b></td>

<p>Group 4: Shared the concept of a plug-in that allows a user to find the taxonomy of a particular research paper, and place it in a research area. Moreover, it offered the valuable function of returning related papers, thus assisting users in discovering additional relevant research in their field of interest.</p>
<p>The discussion on Monday concluded with the class appreciating each other‚Äôs ideas on the possibilities of using plug-ins but also their limitations and associated risks. This exchange of perspectives and ideas highlighted the creative ways in which technology and AI-driven tools could be used to address various challenges and opportunities across different domains.</p>
<h1 id="wednesday-medical-applications-of-llms">Wednesday: Medical Applications of LLMs</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s class started with warm-up story about a young boy who finally got diagnosed from ChatGPT. He saw 17 doctors over 3 years for chronic pain but they couldn‚Äôt diagnosis what made boy painful. One day, his parents explained the boy‚Äôs symptom to ChatGPT and they got a reliable answer. They brought this information to a doctor and after several tests, he could finally get a diagnosis which was correct information from ChatGPT. This story presents a bright possibilities for the medical use of Chat GPT.</p>
<p>We also got a simple question and had to solve the problem not using ChatGPT.</p>
<table><tr>
  <td><img src="/images/week4/figure4.png" width="95%"></td>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 4 <b></b></td>
</table>
<p>About 70% of students could get an answer ‚ÄúA‚Äù using a simple web search (e.g., duckduckgo or google) at first trial, and 30% of students could get an answer by several attempts.</p>
<p>Later, we were asked to use ChatGPT to get an answer. All students could get a correct answer for at first trial. For a simple question like this, it is unclear if GPT is better than a web search. ChatGPT has been pre-trained from many documents from the web, so it is good at giving general information.</p>
<p>However, if we ask deeper and expertise questions to ChatGPT, it may
not give an answer. We indeed need a LLM model which is trained from
medical information to get a reliable result. (Note that GPT-4 is
already competitive in many ways with models tuneds specifically for
medical applications.)</p>
<h2 id="medical-fine-tuned-llms">Medical fine-tuned LLMs</h2>
<p>There were many attemps to build LLMs trained with medical knowlege. Med-PaLM is one of the representive models, which is fine-tuned PaLM with a medical knowledge. Figure 5 showed that Med-PalM scored 67.2% on USMLE-type questions in the MedQA dataset. Considering that approximate medical pass mark was 60%, Med-PalM was the first LLM model who passed the approximate medical pass mark by Dec 22.</p>

</table>
<p>Recently researchers developed Med-PaLM2. They trained PaLM2 with more medical data and upgraded. Figure 6 shows the brief explaination of how Med-PaLM2 was trained. As a result of training fine-tuned with more and better medical information, it could achieve significant improvement.</p>

</tr>
  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 6 <b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixRanV-rdAQ">(Image source)</a></b>
</table>
<p>The researchers had a same experiment. Figure 7 showed that Med-PaLM2 scored an accuracy of 86.5% on USMLE-type-questions in the MedQA dataset. Compared with other LLM performance before 2023, Med-PaLM2 was the first LLM to reach expert performance.</p>
<p>In comparison to human physicians in High Quality Answer Traits, Med-PaLM2 showed better reflects consensus, better reading comprehension, better knowledge to recall, and better reasoning.</p>
<p>When they tested Potential Answer Risks, physicians omitted more
information, and gave slightly more evidence of demographic bias, and
potentially greater extent/likelihood of harm but Med-PaLM2 gave more
inaccurate/irrelevant information.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 7 <b> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09617.pdf">(Image source)</a></b>
</table>
<p>We have seen evidence showing that Med-PaLM2 performs very well,
but this is just a starting point for the discussion of how AI should
be used in healthcare.</p>
<p>Presenter suggested the one way of increasing the capabilities of Med-LLMs. Extending input data from language to other source of data like image, LLMs could understand better about the condition of patients and give more correct diagnosis. Presenter introduced a multimodal version Med-PaLM, in figure 8. Accuracy of the diagonsis is mainly based on how input data contain the precise information about the patient, so as LLM model could be trained through those multimodal material, there would be larger chances of increasing the capabilities.</p>

  <td colspan=1 align="center"> Figure 8 <b> <a href="https://sites.research.google/med-palm/">(Image source)</a></b>
</table>
<p>Also presenter gave a data about physician evaluation on Multi-Med QA and adversarial Qustion to compare the physician, Med-PaLM1, and Med-PaLM2 as you can see in figure 9. It showed the significant increased capabilities as Med-PaLM developed to Med-PaLM2. Furthermore, Almost evalution on Med-PaLM2 is within the range of physicians and some of evaluation even exceed physicians. Based on this results, presenter opened a discussion.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p><em>What are the potential implications of LLMs reaching or surpassing human expertise in medical knowledge?</em></p>
<p>The discussion raised more questions than answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At what point do we trust doctors vs LLMs and to what extent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are LLMs more convenient than going to a doctor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People will be more prone to self-diagnosis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People could be more honest with AI than a human being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should we let AI write prescriptions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we truly verify what is right and what is wrong?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI could obviously give a better diagnosis than human whose experiences effect diagnoses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would happen when different Ais give different results?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lot of data to train with and fine tuning. Is this worth the time and effort?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is taking accountability for the mistakes made by AI? If a doctor does something wrong, they can have their license taken, but this is that the case for AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we refine and improve LLMs like Med-PaLM2 to be more effective in healthcare applications?</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-questions">Warm-up questions</h2>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s class started with warm-up questions to demonstrate how prompts can help an LLM produce correct answers or desired outcomes. The questions and the prompts were tested in GPT3.5. This task was performed as an in-class experiment where each individual used GPT3.5 to test the questions and help GPT3.5 produce correct answers via prompts.</p>
<p>The three questions were:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>What is 7084 times 0.99?</em></li>
<li><em>I have a magic box that can only transfer coins. If you insert a number of coins in it, the next day each coin will turn into two apples. If I add 10 coins and wait for 3 days, what will happen?</em></li>
<li><em>Among &ldquo;Oregon, Virginia, Wyoming&rdquo;, what is the word that ends with &ldquo;n&rdquo;Ôºü</em></li>
</ol>
<p>While the first question tested the arithmetic capability of the model, the second and the third questions tested common sense and symbolic reasoning, respectively. The initial response from GPT3.5 for all three questions was wrong.</p>
<p>For the first question, providing more examples as prompts did not work. At the same time, an explanation of how to reach the specific answer by decomposing the multiplication into multiple steps helped.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the prompting for the first question and the answer from GPT3.5.</p>

<p>For the second question, providing an example and an explanation behind the reasoning on how to reach the final answer helped GPT produce the correct answer. Here, the prompt included explicitly stating that the magic box can also convert from coins to apples.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the prompting for the second question and the answer from GPT3.5.</p>

<p>While GPT was producing random results for the third question, instructing GPT through examples to take the words, concatenate the last letters, and then find the alphabet&rsquo;s position helped produce the correct answer.</p>

<p>All these examples demonstrate the benefit of using prompts to explore the model&rsquo;s reasoning ability.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-prompt-engineering">What is Prompt Engineering?</h2>
<p>Prompt engineering is a method to communicate and guide LLM to demonstrate a behavior or desired outcomes by crafting prompts that coax the model towards providing the desired response. The model weights or parameters are not updated in prompt engineering.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-prompt-based-learning-different-from-traditional-supervised-learning">How is prompt-based learning different from traditional supervised learning?</h2>
<p>Traditional supervised learning trains a model by taking input and generating an output based on prediction probability. The model learns to map input data to specific output labels. In contrast, prompt-based learning models the probability of the text directly. Here, the inputs are converted to textual strings called prompts. These prompts are used to generate desired outcomes. Prompt-based learning offers more flexibility in adapting the model&rsquo;s behavior to different tasks by modifying the prompts. Retraining the model is not required in this scenario.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the prompts were initially used in language translations and emotion predictions based on texts instead of improving the performance of LLMs.</p>
<h2 id="in-context-learning-and-different-types-of-prompts">In-context learning and different types of prompts</h2>
<p>In-context learning is a powerful approach to fine-tuning or training the model within a specific context. This improves the performance and reliability of the model for the specific task or the environment. Here, the models are given a few examples as reference/instructions that are relevant to the context and are domain-specific.</p>
<p>We can categorized in-context learning into three different types of prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Zero-shot</em> ‚Äì the model predicts the answers given only a natural language description of the task.</li>
</ul>
<center>

<p>Figure 4: <b>Example for zero-shot prompting</b> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">Image Source</a>)</p>
</center>
<ul>
<li><em>One-shot</em> or <em>Few-shot</em> ‚Äì In this scenario, one or few examples are provided that explains the task description the model, i.e. prompting the model with few input-output pairs.</li>
</ul>
<center>
<a href="../images/Week3/Picture8.png"><img src="../images/Week3/Picture8.png" width="65%"></a><br>
<p>Figure 5: Examples for one-shot and fewshot prompting (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">Image Source</a>)</p>
</center>
<ul>
<li><em>Chain-of-thought</em> ‚Äì The given task or question is decomposed into coherent intermediate reasoning steps that are solved before providing the final response. This explores the reasoning ability of the model for each of the provided tasks. It is given in the format <code>&lt;input chain-of-thought output&gt;</code>. The difference between standard prompting and chain-of-thought prompting is depicted in the figure below. In the figure to the right, the highlighted statement in blue is an example of chain-of-thought prompting, where the reasoning behind reaching a final answer is provided as a part of the example. Thus, in the model outcome, the model also outputs its reasoning, highlighted in green, to reach the final answer. In addition, chain-of-thought prompting can revolutionize the way we interact with LLMs and leverage their capabilities, as they provide step-by-step explanations of how a particular response is reached.</li>

<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-prompts-and-fine-tuning">What is the difference between prompts and fine-tuning?</h2>
<p>Prompt engineering focuses on eliciting better output for a given LLM through changing input. Fine-tuning focuses on enhancing model performance by training the model on a smaller, targeted database relevant to the desired task. The similarity is that both methods help improve the model&rsquo;s performance and provide desired outcomes.</p>
<p>Prompt engineering requires no retraining, and the prompting is performed in a single window of the model. At the same time, fine-tuning involves retraining the model and changing the model parameter to improve its performance. Fine-tuning also requires more computational resources compared to prompt engineering.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-the-best-to-use-prompts-vs-fine-tuning">When is the best to use prompts vs fine-tuning?</h2>
<p>The above question was an in-class discussion question, and the discussion points were shared in class. Fine-tuning requires updating model weights and changing parameters. These are useful in applications where there is a requirement for central change. In this scenario, all the users experience similar performance. Prompt-based methods are user-specific in a particular window for further fine-grained control. The model&rsquo;s performance depends on the individual prompts designed by the user. Thus, fine-tuning is more potent than prompt-based methods in scenarios that require centralized tuning.</p>
<p>In scenarios with limited training examples, prompt-based methods can perform well. Fine-tuning methods are data-hungry and require many input data for better model performance. As discussed in the discussion posts, prompts cannot be used as a universal tool for all problems to generate desired outcomes and have performance enhancements. However, in specific scenarios, it can assist users to improve performance and reach desired outcomes for in-context specific tasks.</p>
<h2 id="risk-of-prompts">Risk of Prompts</h2>
<p>The class then discussed the perspectives from risks of prompt: those methods like chain of thoughts already achieve some success in the LLMs. However, prompt engineering can be still a controversial topic. The group brought out two aspects.</p>
<p>First, Reasoning ability of LLMs. The group asked, ‚ÄúDoes CoT empowers LLMs reasoning ability?‚Äù Secondly, there are some bias problems in prompting engineering. The group brought up an example of  ‚ÄúLeBron James took a corner kick.‚Äù Is the following sentence plausible? (A) plausible (B) implausible I think the answer is A and saying ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm curious to hear what you think.‚Äù However, this might inject a bias in the prompt.</p>
<p>The group then brought up an open discussion about two potential kinds of prompting bias and ask the class about how would the prompt format (e.g., Task-specific prompt methods, words selected) and prompt training examples (e.g., label distribution, permutations of training examples) affect LLMs output and the possible debiasing solutions.</p>
<p>The class then discussed two different kinds of prompting bias, the prompt format and the prompt training examples.</p>
<h3 id="discussion-about-prompt-training-examples">Discussion about Prompt training examples</h3>
<p>For label distribution, the class discussed that there needs to be a balance in the training set to avoid overgeneralizing the agreement of the user as some examples that the user interjects an opinion that can be wrong. In these cases, the GPT should learn to disagree with the user when the user is wrong. This is also related to the label distribution, if  the user always provides the example with positive labels, then the LLMs will be more likely to output the positive one in the prediction.</p>
<p>Permutation on the training example: A student mentioned a paper that he just read about why context learning works, provides the label space and the distribution of the input. In the paper, they randomly generate the labels, which might be false, they show that actually is better at zero-shot, though worse than when you provide all the labels. Randomly generated labels actually have a significant performance input.
The sequence of the training example may affect the LLM output, especially for the last example. LLM output tends to output the same label with the last example being provided training example.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-about-prompt-format">Discussion about Prompt format</h2>
<p>Prompt format: the word you selected might affect the prompt because some words may appear more frequently in the coporus and some words may have more correlation with some specific label. Male may relate to more positive terms in their training coporus. some prompting may affect the results. Task-specific prompt methods are related to how you select prompt methods based on specific task.</p>
<p>Finally, the group shared two papers about the bias problem in LLMs.
The first paper<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> shows that different prompts will provide a large variance in accuracy, which indicates LLMs are not that stable. The paper also provides a calibration method that takes the output of the GPT model and another linear layer on it to calibrate the models.
The second paper<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> shows that LLMs do not always say what they think, especially injecting some bias into the prompt. For example, they worked on the CoT and non-CoT and they found that CoT will amplify the bias in the context when the user puts some bias in the prompt.</p>
<p>In conclusion, prompts can be controversial and not always perfect.</p>

<h2 id="open-discussion">Open Discussion</h2>
<p>What do you think are the biggest potential risks of LLMs?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social impact from intentional misuse.</strong> LLM‚Äôs content could be manipulated by the government, can potentially affect elections and raise tensions between countries.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual trust among people could be harmed.</strong> We cannot tell which email or info was written by humans or automatically generated by chatgpt. As a result, we may treat these information more skeptically.</li>
<li><strong>People may overly trust LLM outputs.</strong> We may rely more on asking LLM, which is a second-hand information source, rather than actively searching information by ourselves, overtrusting LLM system. Information pool may be contaminated by LLM if they provide misleading information.</li>
</ul>
<p>How does GPT-4 Respond?</p>
<ul>
<li>Misinformation: Provide wrong / misleading / sensitive information, known as jailbreaking of LLM.</li>
<li>Potential manipulation: People could intentionally hack LLM by giving specific prompts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="case-study-marked-personas">Case Study: Marked Personas</h2>
<p>Myra Cheng, Esin Durmus, Dan Jurafsky. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18189">Marked Personas: Using Natural Language Prompts to Measure Stereotypes in Language Models</a>. ACL 2023.</p>
<p>In this study, ChatGPT was asked to give descriptions about several characters based on different ethnicity / gender / demographic groups, e.g., Asian woman, Black woman and white man.</p>
<p>When describing a character from a non-dominant demographic group, while the overall description is positive, it could still imply some potential stereotypes. For example, ‚ÄúAlmond-shaped eye‚Äù is used in describing an east asian woman while it may sound strange to a real east asian. We can also see that ChatGPT is intentionally trying to build a more diverse and politically correct atmosphere for different groups. In contrast, ChatGPT uses mostly neutral and ordinary words when describing an average white man.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-bias-mitigation">Discussion: Bias mitigation</h2>
<h3 id="group-1">Group 1</h3>
<p>Mitigation could sometimes be overcompensating. As a language model, it should try to be neutral and independent. Also, given that people themselves are biased, and LLM is learning from the human world, we may be over-expecting LLMs to be perfectly unbiased. After all, it is hard to define what is fairness and distinguish between stereotype and prototype, leading to over corrections.</p>
<h3 id="group-2">Group 2</h3>
<p>We may be able to identify the risks by data augmentation (replacing ‚Äúmale‚Äù with ‚Äúfemale‚Äù in prompts). Governments should also be responsible for setting rules and regulating LLMs. (Note: this is controversial, and it is unclear what kinds of regulations might be useful or effective.)</p>
<h3 id="group-4">Group 4</h3>
<p>Companies like OpenAI should publish the mitigation strategies so that it could be understood and monitored by the public. Another aspect is that different groups of people can have very diverse points of views, so it is hard to define the stereotypes and biases with a universal law. Also, the answer could be very different based on the prompts, making it even harder to mitigate</p>
<h2 id="hands-on-activity-prompt-hacking">Hands-on Activity: Prompt Hacking</h2>
<p>In this activity, the class was trying to make ChatGPT generate sensitive / bad responses. It could be done by setting a pretended identity, e.g. pretending to be a Hutu person in Rwanda in the 1990s or pretending to be a criminal. With these conditions, ChatGPT‚Äôs barrier of biased or evil contents can be partly bypassed.</p>
<h2 id="discussion-can-we-defend-against-prompt-hacking-by-build-in-safegurads">Discussion: Can we defend against prompt hacking by build-in safegurads?</h2>
<p>As we can see in the activity, right now this safeguard is not that strong. A more practical way may be to add a disclaimer at the end of potentially sensitive content and give a questionnaire to collect feedback for better iteration. Companies should also actively identify these jailbreakings and attempt to mitigate them.</p>
<h2 id="further-thoughts-whats-the-real-risk">Further thoughts: What&rsquo;s the real risk?</h2>
<p>While jailbreaking is one of the risks of LLMs, a more risky situation may be that LLM is intentionally trained and used by people to do bad things. After all, misuse is not that serious compared with a specific crime.</p>

<h2 id="before-sunday-questions-about-chain-of-thought-prompting">Before Sunday: Questions about Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compared to other types of prompting, do you believe that chain-of-thought prompting represents the most effective approach for enhancing the performance of LLMs? Why or why not? If not, could you propose an alternative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper highlights several examples where chain-of-thought prompting can significantly improve its outcomes, such as in solving math problems, applying commonsense reasoning, and comprehending data. Considering these improvements, what additional capabilities do you envision for LLMs using chain-of-thought prompting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are different language models in the experiment performing differently with chain-of-thought prompting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try some of your own experiments with prompt engineering using your favorite LLM, and report interesting results. Is what you find consistent with what you expect from the paper? Are you able to find any new prompting methods that are effective?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="by-tuesday-questions-about-marked-personas">By Tuesday: Questions about Marked Personas</h2>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The paper addresses potential harms from LLMs by identifying the underlying stereotypes present in their generated contents. Additionally, the paper offers methods to examine and measure those stereotypes. Can this approach effectively be used to diminish stereotypes and enhance fairness? What are the main limitations of the work?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper mentions racial stereotypes identified in downstream applications such as story generation. Are there other possible issues we might encounter when the racial stereotypes in LLMs become problematic after its application?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the evaluation in this work uses a list of White and Black stereotypical attributes provided by Ghavami and Peplau (2013) as the human-written responses and compares them with the list of LLMs generated responses. This, however, does not encompass all racial backgrounds and is heavily biased by American attitudes about racial categories, and they might not distinguish between races in great detail. Do you believe there could be a notable difference when more comprehensive racial representation is incorporated? If yes, what potential differences may arise? If no, why not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This work emphasizes the naturalness of the input provided to the LLM, while we have previously seen examples of eliciting harmful outputs by using less natural language. What potential benefits or risks are there in not investigating less natural inputs (e.g., prompt injection attacks including the suffix attack we saw in Week 2)? Can you suggest a less natural prompt that could reveal additional or alternate stereotypes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authors recommend transparency of bias mitigation methods, citing the benefit it could provide to researchers and practitioners. Specifically, how might researchers benefit from this? Can you foresee any negative consequences (either to researchers or the general users of these models) of this transparency?</p>
